                    Swedish illustrator, designer and animator Linn Fritz lives and works in London where 
                    she creates charmingly clean, precise imagery in a trademark pastel palette for a wide 
                    range of editorial and commercial clients. Her neat, fluid line work was honed during 
                    her time at Hyper Island, a time which Linn cites as “hands down one of the best experiences” 
                    of her life. “My Hyper Island journey completely changed me as a person.” she says, “It
                    pushed me to work harder and gave me the tools to succeed in the real world.” The progressive 
                    nature of Hyper Island led Linn to abandon pen and paper and concentrate on what digital could 
                    offer her already well-honed drawings. As she puts it, “There’s more freedom drawing digitally, 
                    and more room for mistakes.” Alongside her editorial and commercial projects, Linn is the co-founder 
                    of Panimation, “a community of equality-driven women, trans and non-binary friends aiming to 
                    connect and support each other within the animation industry.” Some of her favorite projects
                    often orbit around her interests of “feminism, clothes, plants and interior” but Linn also 
                    looks for a good client relationship, one with trust and creative freedom.
